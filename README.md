## CC-shop Online Shopping Project

We built this project because we want to create the POS system using J2EE technologies which consist of many tech stacks - JDBC, JavaServlet, JSP, and other Java libraries. In this UI design, we reference some online sources.
We gained a lot of experience in building this project, we have to consider the complex structure of how to make the interaction between User > Seller > Admin. In this project we use 
the **javax.mail** for real-time notification and other js libs like sweertalert and chart.js for real-time analysis. We also use the **OTP system for password changing and saving the password in the format of BCrypt** 
Let me explain, 

### Seller
